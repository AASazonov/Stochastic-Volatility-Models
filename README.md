# Student Research Group "Stochastic Volatility Models"
## Project 'Heston-2'
1. Report: a review of Heston numerical simulations

* Give a talk on Euler, Broadie-Kaya, and Andersen schemes 

* Price the options using MC simulations. Compare the MC prices with closed-form theoretical prices for the vanilla European call options

* Calculate the greeks numerically

2. A numerical experiment and a report: improve a library implementation

* Implement E+M method from the article by Mrázek, Pospíšil (2017). Use Numba and/or CUDA if possible

* Reimplement Broadie-Kaya method to speed it up

3. A numerical experiment: compare different schemes of Heston simulation

* For a given class of derivatives (both vanilla and exotics) compare the performance

* Write a report
