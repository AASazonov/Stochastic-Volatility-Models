   abstract = {Stochastic volatility models are increasingly important in practical derivatives pricing applications, yet relatively little work has been undertaken in the development of practical Monte Carlo simulation methods for this class of models. This paper considers several new algorithms for time-discretization and Monte Carlo simulation of Heston-type stochastic volatility models. The algorithms are based on a careful analysis of the properties of affine stochastic volatility diffusions, and are straightforward and quick to implement and execute. Tests on realistic model parameterizations reveal that the computational efficiency and robustness of the simulation schemes proposed in the paper compare very favorably to existing methods.},

  abstract = {The Monte Carlo approach has proved to be a valuable and flexible computational tool in modern finance. This paper discusses some of the recent applications of the Monte Carlo method to security pricing problems, with emphasis on improvements in efficiency. We first review some variance reduction methods that have proved useful in finance. Then we describe the use of deterministic low-discrepancy sequences, also known as quasi-Monte Carlo methods, for the valuation of complex derivative securities. We summarize some recent applications of the Monte Carlo method to the estimation of partial derivatives or risk sensitivities and to the valuation of American options. We conclude by mentioning other applications.},

  abstract  = {This paper uses an intertemporal general equilibrium asset pricing model to study the term structure of interest rates. In this model, anticipations, risk aversion, investment alternatives, and preferences about the timing of consumption all play a role in determining bond prices. Many of the factors traditionally mentioned as influencing the term structure are thus included in a way which is fully consistent with maximizing behavior and rational expectations. The model leads to specific formulas for bond prices which are well suited for empirical testing.},

The classical importance sampling method is used to eliminate the variance caused by the linear part of the logarithmic function of payoff. The variance caused by the quadratic part is reduced by stratified sampling. We eliminate both kinds of variances just by importance sampling. The corresponding space for the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of the logarithmic function of payoff is enlarged. Computational Simulation shows the high efficiency of the new method.},
