        Basically, the error of discretization consists of two parts: the discretization error itself (the one coming from the transition from an stochastic differential equation to the stochastic difference equation) and the Monte-Carlo error (see Section \ref{Monte-Carlo:statistical}).
        We controlled the errors with the following method:

    We shall compare the methods for the European call option prices due to that we have a closed form solution for it.
