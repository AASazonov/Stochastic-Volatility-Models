  abstract  = {Summary The Heston model, named after Steven Heston, is a mathematical model describing the evolution of the volatility of an underlying asset. It is astochastic volatility model: such a model assumes that the volatility of the asset is not constant, nor even deterministic, but follows a random process. This chapter presents the most well-known and popular stochastic volatility model, the Heston model, and provides a detailed derivation of the Heston European option valuation formula, implementation of which follows straightforwardly from the derivation. It also shows how to discretize the Heston process for Monte Carlo simulation and with some appreciation for the complexity and expense of numerical computations, highlights the main reasons for the Heston model's popularity.}
